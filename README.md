# NOTES APP
## [DEMO](https://haim-note-app.netlify.app)

This is my first react application I've made, yea It's the classic to-do list.
What I'm really proud of is that I didn't watch any todo app tutorials before creating it, just the written instructions of my bootcamp.

This app also using MaterialUI for some components and the data is stored locally with [localForage](https://github.com/localForage/localForage).
In the future I plan to improve the design and make a real backend.

After that project I started to realize the real power of react, and how much it simplify everything with renders and states. \
Now I really like to make my own components and hooks.
